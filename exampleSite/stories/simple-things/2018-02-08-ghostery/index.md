> Ghostery helps you browse smarter by giving you control over ads and tracking technologies to speed up page loads, eliminate clutter, and protect your data.

While uBlock aims at stopping ads, Ghostery goes one step forward and blocks the ads' tracking scripts from running, thus making the site load faster.
