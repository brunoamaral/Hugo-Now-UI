> Be My Eyes is an app that connects blind and visually impaired with sighted volunteers from around the world via live video call.

This app goes beyond the idea of a 'simple things' app because it does more than solve a problem. It connect people.

Give it a try and please spread it among others who may need it or wish to become volunteers.
