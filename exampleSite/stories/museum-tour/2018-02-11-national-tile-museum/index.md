Any place is a good place to start. I chose this one for several reasons, one of which my curiosity to see if we can indeed say so much about portuguese tiles and how it would match the [tile work I had seen in the Bardo Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_National_Museum_(Tunis)).

Long story short, yes you can.

The religious motifs are very present, as was to be expected, but there is also work by more contemporary artists like JÃºlio Pomar. 

The Museum occupies an old convent, so the whole walk around the cloister adds a second level of interest. The church inside is also an exquisite work of craftsmanship that was well preserved over the years.

It makes for an interesting morning, that can end with coffee or lunch in the cafeteria near the garden of the Museum.
